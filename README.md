# Khodar Events

An application for communities event management built with Koitlin 

🛸 ### Hello Android Developers! I'm Manuel and this is my solution for the 2-week running sprint held by TurboKode called #Khodar! 😊

🛠️ Built with:

    Koitlin 🧾
    Java 🤖
    Mobile first workflow approach: Android Studio 📲

This project was a good challenge in many aspects. Each input needed a diferent type of validation and I didn't know how to do some of them, so I had to learn them while doing it and with the help of mentors. Although this wa my first time programming with Koitlin and working with Android Studio, I had a very good time practicing it.

An excellent challenge to practice many different skills at once! 😊

Thanks to the TurboKhode team that create challenges that make us learn a lot from doing them. 💟

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve this project, feel free to leave me a comment!

Feedback welcome 😊
